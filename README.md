# Biofects
Biofects theme is: A modern HUD display for Home Assistant.  **[WIP]**

# About this theme and why i made it
I made this theme to give a easy on the eyes look and simple to use for my family. This theme for my layout is also using many additional plugins to give me a look and feel that we found to be easy to navigate

1. My Home assistnat runs on a server in Docker. No I do not used supervised, no I do not send data to Home Assistant. This is my choice to struggle a bit more than a managed OS but I am ok with that. 

<strong style="color:red;">I dont know how it works with HAOS</stong>

2. I also try to secure any **phone home** calls from IOT devices on my network. 
3. I have many IOT devices I have are need to add to my Home Assistant
    - Hue
    - Tuya 
    - Different Appliances
    - Grafana to monitor everything
    - Emby
    - Fans
    - Local AI running on server
    - Pi Hole to block ads
    - All my network gear, server, GPU, Filers monitoring, security
    - Door Locks
    - Cameras
This is just examples of what is in my Home Assistant. With plans to add more.
